# PolishCow.Live
PolishCow.live is a random project i made in a weekend inspired by parrot.live (Terminal-Parrot)
# 🐄 PolishCow.live

Try It Yourself in any terminal! (But not powershell)
```bash
curl polishcow.live


A project inspired by [parrot.live](https://parrot.live) [Terminal-parrot](https://github.com/jmhobbs/terminal-parrot) and  featuring the one and only **Polish Dancing Cow**.  
Stream it straight into your terminal with just `curl`!

Please Note I'm Not An Experienced Programmer, Its Just A Random Project That I (A 15 Year Old) Made In A Weeekend :D

Any Issues I Need To Adress Add Them In The Issues Section And I Might Look At It Within A Week Or Two ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Thank You For Looking At This Silly Project I Made :D
